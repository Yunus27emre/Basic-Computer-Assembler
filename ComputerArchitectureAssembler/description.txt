My implementation of a simple assembler for the Basic Computer architecture.
The program:

Reads instructions from Program.txt

Validates formatting and hexadecimal correctness

Converts symbolic instructions into machine code

Supports all 25 Basic Computer instructions

Prints both binary (16-bit) and hexadecimal outputs

Includes error handling for invalid commands, missing addresses, and wrong formats

The project is structured with multiple classes (Basic_Computer, Code_Decode, FileRead, Look_Error) for clean and modular design.
